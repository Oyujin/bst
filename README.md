##MountainHike
#This project is to simulate a hiker going down a mountain.
#The goal of the project is to find a path that safely gets the hiker to the foot of the mountain.
#Mountain is implemented using self balancing, self implented BST.
#Each node in the BST represents a rest stop and they have challanges, supplies and food.
#Challanges are fallen tree and river. 
#You need to clear the challenges to go down. To cross the river you need a raft, to go over the fallen tree you need an axe.
#Furthermore, as you go down the mountain, the food supply gets diminished. 
#So considering all these facts the project is to create a tree and find a path.
